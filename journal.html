	<h1>Journal entry one - 9/21/23 </h1>

	<p>
	To save my journal to the internet, I went onto my terminal and I opened my folder from my desktop. I then found a font and I copied it into Sublime and my terminal. I git added, committed and pushed the font on my terminal so it was then online. I wrote "git add ." then "git commit -m "adding font" and then git push to connect it all. I then went to my journal website and I found my text that I typed on sublime there. </p>

	<h1>Journal entry two - 9/26/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today we had our fourth class of computer science. We worked on our website profiles and I made one with a blue star on it.
	</p>

	<h1>Journal entry three - 10/3/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today we made an animation and then we put it online. I made a square that changes colors and spins into a circle. It was really fun and I learned that I needed to make percentages (0-100) for the animation to follow. I added what I wanted it to do to each percentage and then I put it online.
	</p>
	<h1>Journal entry four - 10/12/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today we learned a new language, javascript. We made boxes and we inspected the page to learn about the margin, border, and padding. We then wrote "document.addEventListener" which makes the page listen for something and record the event. I chose to make it log the mousemove but I can also make it log the "keypress” and “click”. It recorded whenever I moved my mouse and the data about it in the console page when I press inspect. If I don't put event, it doesn't record the data from what I did like where on the screen my mouse was.
	</p>
	<h1>Journal entry five - 10/26/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today and throughout this week we learned how to use event listeners. We made it so that the website would listen for a click and then when clicked, a jumpscare gif would come up. This class we learned to add a soound by downloading it off of youtube and adding it to the event listener so when someone would click on the website, the gif and sound would come up.
