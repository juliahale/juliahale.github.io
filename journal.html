	<h1>Journal entry one - 9/21/23 </h1>

	<p>
	To save my journal to the internet, I went onto my terminal and I opened my folder from my desktop. I then found a font and I copied it into Sublime and my terminal. I git added, committed and pushed the font on my terminal so it was then online. I wrote "git add ." then "git commit -m "adding font" and then git push to connect it all. I then went to my journal website and I found my text that I typed on sublime there. </p>

	<h1>Journal entry two - 9/26/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today we had our fourth class of computer science. We worked on our website profiles and I made one with a blue star on it.
	</p>

	<h1>Journal entry three - 10/3/23 </h1>
	<p>
	Today we made an animation and then we put it online. I made a square that changes colors and spins into a circle. It was really fun and I learned that I needed to make percentages (0-100) for the animation to follow. I added what I wanted it to do to each percentage and then I put it online.
