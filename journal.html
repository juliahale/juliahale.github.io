	<h1>1st week of Comp Sci 1: </h1>

	<p>
	To save my journal to the internet, I went onto my terminal and I opened my folder from my desktop. I then found a font and I copied it into Sublime and my terminal. I git added, committed and pushed the font on my terminal so it was then online. I wrote "git add ." then "git commit -m "adding font" and then git push to connect it all. I then went to my journal website and I found my text that I typed on sublime there.
